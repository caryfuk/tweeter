# Tweeter

This thing displays current tweets on your timeline on your Arduino using cool johnny-five javascript framework.

To run it, you need to set up your API access on Twitter and create file twitter-access.json with following content:
```
{
  "CONSUMER_KEY": "key",
  "CONSUMER_SECRET": "secret",
  "ACCESS_TOKEN": "your access key",
  "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET": "your access secret"
}
```

Then do:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Enjoy! :)
